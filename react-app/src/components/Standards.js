                            Use menu questions to obtain guest allergy information as this is another critical standard.

                            Obtain relevant information from the guest.
                            Example: Obtain cooking instructions for Steak dishes, accompaniments, and always accommadate off menu requests (if possible and if they are reasonable).

                            Repeat the order back to the guest to ensure accuracy. Advise delivery time.

                <h2>Pros to Phone Calls</h2>
                <p>
                    Use the phone call to build rapport with the guest.  This gives us opportunity to connect with the guest and build a relationship.
                    Most importantly use the call to upsell beverages to begin the meal, or starters for example.  Use wine and cocktail knowledge to offer a nightcap or evening beverage.
                    Suggest a dessert to be served at the end of the meal, or at a later time.
                </p>
                <p>
               I can confidently say I sell 5-10 evians every day or two just by offering the guest a bottle of water to start their meal.
